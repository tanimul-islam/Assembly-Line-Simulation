# üè≠ Assembly Line Simulation (MS03)
A C++ simulation project that models a real-world **assembly line production system**, where customer orders move through a series of workstations, each responsible for filling specific items based on availability and sequence.
> üíº **Built as part of an advanced C++ programming course, this project demonstrates mastery in object-oriented design, file-driven logic, memory management, and STL-based simulation control.**
> 
## üìÇ Project Structure
main.cpp ‚Üí Entry point, sets up and runs the simulation
Utilities.[h|cpp] ‚Üí Token extraction and field formatting for file parsing
Station.[h|cpp] ‚Üí Represents an inventory station with item info and stock
Workstation.[h|cpp] ‚Üí Inherits Station, manages order queues and item processing
CustomerOrder.[h|cpp] ‚Üí Models customer order with dynamic item lists
LineManager.[h|cpp] ‚Üí Configures and orchestrates the assembly line process

## üîß How It Works

The simulation uses **four input files** provided via the command line:
```bash
./ms3 Stations1.txt Stations2.txt CustomerOrders.txt AssemblyLine.txt
```
1. Stations1.txt & Stations2.txt ‚Äì Initialize stations with names, quantities, descriptions, etc.
2. CustomerOrders.txt ‚Äì Defines multiple customer orders with lists of required items.
3. AssemblyLine.txt ‚Äì Establishes the order and linkages of workstations in the line.

The application then:
 - Displays initial station info (summary and full)
 - Loads and displays customer orders
 - Validates station methods (e.g., serial number generation, quantity    updates)
 - Builds the assembly line
 - Iteratively processes orders through the line, filling items or marking them incomplete
 - Outputs completed and incomplete orders
 - Shows final inventory state

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated
-   **Object-Oriented Design**
    -   Inheritance (`Workstation` extends `Station`)    
    -   Composition (`CustomerOrder` holds `Item` objects)
-   **Dynamic Memory Management**
    -   Manual `new/delete` handling in `CustomerOrder`
-   **STL Containers & Algorithms**
    -   `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::count`, `std::any_of`, `std::for_each`
-    **Move Semantics & Rule of 5**
    -   `CustomerOrder` explicitly deletes copy operations, defines move operations
-    **File I/O and Parsing**
    -   Custom `Utilities` class to tokenize input using flexible delimiters
-    **Simulation Loop Design**
    -   Iterative control via `LineManager::run()`
    

## üìÅ Sample Input Files
You can use the provided:

-   `Stations1.txt`
-   `Stations2.txt`    
-   `CustomerOrders.txt`
-   `AssemblyLine.txt`

Ensure these are placed in the root directory and formatted properly (comma/pipe delimited).

## üí° Highlights
-   This project simulates real-world **manufacturing workflows**
-   Strong understanding of **C++ memory models**
-   Proficient in **modular design**, **data processing**, and **simulation engineering**
-   Capable of building and managing **mid-sized systems** in C++ using OOP principles
## üöÄ Getting Started
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o ms3 *.cpp
# Run with sample files
./ms3 Stations1.txt Stations2.txt CustomerOrders.txt AssemblyLine.txt
```
